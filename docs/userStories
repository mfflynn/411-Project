As a non-logged-in user, I want to be able to have the option of logging into the app via Youtube OAuth from a Google api, so that I can connect myself on this application to my Youtube account.

As a logged-in user, I want to be able to input a Spotify playlist url, and see the output that is a list of embedded Youtube videos, one for each song on my original Spotify playlist.
	-If a song is not successfully added to the playlist, I want to see an indication that this song was not added.
	
As a logged-in user, I want to input a Spotify playlist url, and have the app create a Youtube playlist for me of all of the songs that are on that Spotify playlist automatically.
	-If a playlist was not successfully created, I want to see an indication that there has been an issue.
	
As a logged-in user, I want to input a Spotify playlist url, and receive a link to a Youtube playlist of those songs.
